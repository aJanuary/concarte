# ConCarte

ConCarte lets you turn a static images of your venue map into an interactive map
that can be panned, zoomed and searched.

It is designed for use at small to medium sized conventions.

## Features

- **Interactive map**: Users can pan and zoom the map.
- **Search**: Users can search for rooms and booths.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the map with your own images and data.
- **Open source**: The project is open source and free to use.
- **Self-hosted**: You can host the map on your own server.
- **Static pages**: The output is static pages, making it easy to host.
- **No tracking**: The map does not track users.
- **No dependencies**: The map does not depend on any third-party services.
- **No ads**: The map does not show ads.

### Roadmap

We don't have an official roadmap, as we are a small team working on this
as a side project. However, we would like to add the following features:

- **Responsive**: The map works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessible**: The map is accessible to screen readers and keyboard users.
- **Offline support**: The map works offline after the first visit.

## Building

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

### Production

Run the production build:

````bash

```bash
yarn build
````

The output will be in the `out` directory. This can be hosted on any static file
server. It does require the URLs to be rewritten to remove the `.html`
extension.

#### Example nginx config

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;

  root /var/www/out;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
  }

  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
    internal;
  }
}
```
